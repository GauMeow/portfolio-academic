      - Developed a model for predicting tendon robot shape as 3D point clouds based on current tendon displacements with long short-term memory (LSTM), exceeding the previous learning-based technique by 11% in terms of Chamfer distance.
      - Collaborated in a Bayesian optimization approach for automating surgical retraction by implementing different acquisition functions for optimizing tissue retraction efficiency and improving attachment point detection accuracy.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
