Check out our report [here](../../uploads/report.html)

Our mission is to increase student SAT scores by looking at factors like attendance and what section students focus on when studying for their SATs. We use two datasets in our analysis: The first one includes the mean SAT scores by section of each school in New York (2010); The second one is the enrollment and attendance history of the schools in New York. Our questions of interest include the following:

- Does school attendance have an impact on the total SAT mean score?

- Is there any difference in mean SAT Reading and Writing scores?

Through regression analysis and hypothesis testing we will provide statistical insight into these questions. We believe that students SAT scores would benefit from increasing their attendance in school as well as the knowledge that reading and writing are potentially linked thus improving one may have a doubling effect in overall score.
