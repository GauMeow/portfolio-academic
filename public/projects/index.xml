      <title>Workspace Manager</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I worked with a team to develop Workspace Manager, a tool designed to streamline workflow by allowing users to create and manage custom workspaces. The goal of the application was to help users quickly launch all the necessary applications, files, and tools for specific tasks with just one click. This project was built using JavaScript and MongoDB as the backend database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contributions involved implementing the core functionality that allows users to save multiple file paths and applications into a workspace, making it easy to launch them simultaneously. I also worked on user authentication, incorporating encrypted passwords for secure account management and enabling multiple users to create their personalized workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project gave me hands-on experience with database management in MongoDB, allowing us to store user preferences and workspace configurations. I also improved my ability to troubleshoot issues and collaborate effectively with a team under tight deadlines. The next steps for the project involve bug fixes and potential integration of Git automation to make workspace management even more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Workspace Manager showcases my skills in developing practical tools that enhance user productivity, with a focus on user-friendly design and efficient back-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of attendance on SAT scores</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to increase student SAT scores by looking at factors like attendance and what section students focus on when studying for their SATs. We use two datasets in our analysis: The first one includes the mean SAT scores by section of each school in New York (2010); The second one is the enrollment and attendance history of the schools in New York. Our questions of interest include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does school attendance have an impact on the total SAT mean score?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any difference in mean SAT Reading and Writing scores?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through regression analysis and hypothesis testing we will provide statistical insight into these questions. We believe that students SAT scores would benefit from increasing their attendance in school as well as the knowledge that reading and writing are potentially linked thus improving one may have a doubling effect in overall score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Highway crossing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/highway-crossing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/highway-crossing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this collaborative project, I worked with a team of three to design and develop a 3D car highway crossing game using C# and OpenGL. The primary objective of the game was to guide a car through multiple lanes of fast-moving highway traffic without crashing into obstacles. The game offered players a challenging and engaging experience with progressively more difficult levels as they navigated through increasingly congested highways and obstacle speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My key responsibilities included rendering 3D objects and textures using OpenGL, ensuring smooth visual transitions and enhancing the overall appearance of the game world. We utilized OpenGL to model cars, roads, and other environmental elements, focusing on clear and functional visuals rather than realistic graphics. Additionally, I implemented audio effects to provide a more immersive experience for players, with sounds for engine revs, collisions, and background ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout development, we collaborated closely, solving challenges such as optimizing object collisions, creating responsive controls, and synchronizing audio with gameplay. The project not only deepened my understanding of OpenGL and C#, but also honed my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and game mechanics development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this project demonstrated my ability to work in a team setting to create a fully functional 3D game, blending programming, 3D rendering, and audio design to deliver an engaging user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
