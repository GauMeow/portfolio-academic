      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I worked with a team to develop Workspace Manager, a tool designed to streamline workflow by allowing users to create and manage custom workspaces. The goal of the application was to help users quickly launch all the necessary applications, files, and tools for specific tasks with just one click, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for a coding session, a design project, or content creation. This project was built using JavaScript and MongoDB as the backend database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application supports multiple users, each with the ability to create personalized workspaces. With password-encrypted accounts, it ensures secure access and keeps your workspace configurations private. Users can easily add and store multiple file paths and applications within each workspace, so everything you need for a particular task is just a single action away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Password encryption
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Workspace Manager relies on MongoDB to handle data storage efficiently. When a user sets up their custom workspace, the application saves all file paths, application preferences, and user settings in the MongoDB database. This database structure allows for quick retrieval of information, making it easy for the application to launch the desired tools and files together when prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back-end logic, built with JavaScript, manages these interactions by communicating with the database to fetch the necessary data and execute commands to open the applications. This ensures a smooth and secure experience, as the password-encrypted accounts are also managed through MongoDB, safeguarding user configurations and workspaces. The front-end interface, developed with ClackJS, provides a seamless user experience, handling user inputs and delivering responses quickly by leveraging the data stored in MongoDB. Together, these components work in harmony to offer a streamlined and efficient workspace setup process.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Launching all workspace files at once
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By consolidating the process of launching applications and files into a single action, Workspace Manager lets you dive right into your work, helping you maximize productivity and focus on what really matters. It&amp;rsquo;s an invaluable tool for anyone looking to enhance their workflow, reducing the setup time and allowing you to work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of attendance on SAT scores</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This analysis delves into the relationship between school attendance and SAT scores in New York high schools using data from 2010. The primary aim was to determine if higher attendance rates have a significant impact on students&amp;rsquo; SAT performance and to explore potential differences between SAT reading and writing scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study utilized two datasets: the SAT College Board 2010 results, which included mean scores for reading, writing, and math, and daily attendance records from the NYC Department of Education. By applying regression analysis, the research investigated the correlation between the average SAT scores and school attendance rates. Additionally, hypothesis testing was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the SAT reading and writing scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact of Attendance on SAT Scores: Our regression model revealed a positive relationship between school attendance and total SAT scores (sum of reading, writing, and math). The linear regression model predicted that a school with 100% attendance would have an average total SAT score of 1395.292. However, the residual plot suggested that the relationship may be non-linear, indicating that a quadratic model could better represent the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SAT analysis&#34; srcset=&#34;
               /projects/sat-analysis/image_hu8007387510409428976.webp 400w,
               /projects/sat-analysis/image_hu16887807423629504061.webp 760w,
               /projects/sat-analysis/image_hu5486022362280592373.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/image_hu8007387510409428976.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;543&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference Between SAT Reading and Writing Scores: Through hypothesis testing, we found a significant difference between mean SAT reading and writing scores (p-value &amp;lt; 2.2e-16). The mean difference was about 6.54 points, with reading scores typically higher than writing scores. This suggests that improving reading scores does not necessarily result in equivalent gains in writing scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SAT analysis&#34; srcset=&#34;

               /projects/sat-analysis/image2_hu16173688565652375430.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/image2_hu7765877957456203830.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;543&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis supported the idea that increased attendance has a positive impact on SAT performance, though further research is needed to explore the non-linear relationship indicated by the residuals. This project honed my skills in R programming, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing, while providing an opportunity to collaborate on meaningful educational research.&lt;/p&gt;
